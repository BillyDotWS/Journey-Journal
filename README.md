# Journey-Journal
Within this University task, I was asked to create a mobile application. I was given specifications by a client and had to design, program and release a mobile application that met the given requirements, without further consulting the client within this process.

# 📝 Requirements:
> - User registration and login.
> - Main home area of the app.
> - Create a journal entry.
> - Manage my journal entries (Delete entry & Edit entry)
> - The ability to Geotag a journal entry so the location of the entry can be recorded and then viewed on a map.
